# QO-Agent
Implemented QO Agent according to “Negotiating with bounded rational agents in environments with incomplete information using an automated agent” article which is written by Raz Lin, Sarit Kraus, Jonathan Wilkenfeld and James Barry for my second mandatory intern in Summer 2019 in Ozyegin University.

According to article, QO agent uses a database for its decisions. However, we did not have a database that holds the records of past negotiations of its own and also other agents'. So that, we need to create that database with our helper classes "AgentGeneratorForQO" and AgetForQO".
